# ScrollWithoutSubmission

Isn't it wonderful blocking all the annoyances on the internet? 

Unfortunately, some of those annoyances turn out to be those privacy dialogs that want you to consent to handing over all your personal information.

Even more unfortunately, lots of those dialogs come with some prickly CSS that sets something like `body {overflow: hidden;}`. Which means you can't scroll the webpage any more.

This is my personal collection of uBlock Origin-compatible rules for un-breaking those pages. Feel free to make a PR to add new rules (but as this is a personal collection I can't make any guarantees about responding within a reasonable timeframe!)
